    <h3 id="About">About Me:</h3> <!--First section of the page, an about me page-->
    <p>

        Hello! This is my first ever website built with html and css. My name is Matthew Tran and I am currently a student at the University of Massachusetts - Lowell, living in North Chelmsford.
        I am from the city of Chico, California and came up to Massachusetts for college, where most of my family is from.
        I am currently studying for a bachelor's degree in computer science and I am about to be in my senior year.
        Below are some links to my Resume and Linkedin, respectively.

    </p>

    <div class="centerdiv">

        <a href='Files/Resume.pdf' target="_blank"> Resume </a> <br /> <br />

    <h3 id="hobbies">My Hobbies</h3> <!--next navigational checkpoint-->
    <p>
        Another hobby of mine is collecting nfts. If you click the red button to the right of my photo it would
        bring up a picture of my favorite online identity. The left button would bring back a picture of me! Collecting NFT's
        started out as an investment opportunity for me and now I've been inspired by their decentralized ideas which has led me
        to taking this class.
    </p>

    <h4>Fishing</h4> <!--sub-sections of hobbies-->
    <p>
        Another hobby of mine is fishing. Fishing is something I got into 4 years ago while in California when I would go up
        in the mountains to fish for trout in the local streams and rivers. Today I mainly fish for bass in the local lakes and
        ponds around massachusetts.

        The picure on the left was taken in Deerk Creek, California with me holding a pike minnow.
        The picture on the right is of my largest bass to date caught at Silver Lake in Tewksbury.
    </p>

    <h4>Skating</h4>

    <p>
        Another hobby of mine is skateboarding. I have been skateboarding on and off since highschool ever since I was
        introducted to it by my friend Riley in sophomore year. The video below is a video of me performing a
        kickflip in flip flops.

    <h3 id="favmovies">My Favorite Movies</h3>
    <p>
        Along with fishing and skateboarding, I also enjoy watching movies in my free time. Below are some of the most
        recent movies that I have watched along with my personal ratings along with them.

    </div>

    <p>
        These ratings for the movies are completely personal and just from my own opinion. Spiderman: No Way home was a great
        movie for what it is, but was not that amazing outside of that superhero genre. Everything Everywhere All At Once was like
        a dark horse who came out of nowhere and blew my expectations out of the water with its amazing cinetography, story and performance
        by the actors. Disney's Encanto was a great movie as well although I expected more story out of it and it felt sort of rushed.
        The Adam Project was recommended to me by my father and my computer architecture teacher, although I had low expectations as it was a
        Netflix film and recommended by my Father who watches documentaries all day. The Adam Project was entertaining to watch and
        was a good laugh with a story that was all over the place in a good way.
